This is the root directory for a simple FTP program that was made for ICT310 
Semester 2, 2013 at Murdoch University. It contains a document detailing the
protocol the server and client use to communicate and two directories which
contain the source files for the client (myftp) and the server (myftpd). These
programs have been written in C and are intended to be run on a Linux based
operating system.
